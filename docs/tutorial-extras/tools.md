# React Development tools

## CLI Tools

Here is the list of most common CLI tools for React development

### Create react App

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
Set up a modern web app by running one command

#### Less to Learn
You don't need to learn and configure many build tools. Instant reloads help you focus on development. When it's time to deploy, your bundles are optimized automatically.

#### Only One Dependency
Your app only needs one build dependency. We test Create React App to make sure that all of its underlying pieces work together seamlessly – no complicated version mismatches.

#### No Lock-In
Under the hood, we use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and other amazing projects to power your app. If you ever want an advanced configuration, you can ”eject” from Create React App and edit their config files directly.
